# Trend Prediction in Financial Markets Using Metaheuristic-Enhanced Machine Learning Models

This repository explores the application of **metaheuristic algorithms**, specifically a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**, to enhance machine learning models for financial market trend prediction. By leveraging metaheuristics, we aim to improve baseline model performance through two key areas:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant subset features from a large set of engineered features to optimize model accuracy and reduce complexity.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and refining additional features to better capture patterns in financial time series data.
